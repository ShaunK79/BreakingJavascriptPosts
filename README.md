Documenting my learning by posting on LinkedIn

New Beginnings & Learning to Code 💡

After spending 14–15 years as an electrician, redundancy last year gave me the push to pursue something new—software development. I’m currently studying and focusing on JavaScript, and I’ve decided to document my journey here on LinkedIn.

Each week, I’ll share what I’ve learned, the challenges I’ve faced, and my progress. My goal is not just to stay accountable but also to connect with others on a similar path, get advice, and hopefully inspire those thinking about making a career shift.

If you're also learning JavaScript (or already working in development), I’d love to hear your thoughts and any tips you have! Let’s grow together. 🚀

Week 1: My JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀

This week, I started with the fundamentals: variables and data types in JavaScript. I learned how to declare variables using let, const, and var, and the importance of choosing the right one. I also explored different data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects—each playing a key role in how JavaScript handles data.

One key takeaway: Understanding data types early makes debugging and writing clean code much easier!

Next week, I'll dive deeper into JavaScript fundamentals. If you have any tips or resources that helped you, I’d love to hear them!

Week 2 - Arrays and Operators.

This week, I completed arrays and operators. Fairly straightforward concepts, but there are many built-in methods and nuances to remember! I practiced different array operations like push, pop, toString, reverse and shift/unShift (many more). I also explored operators—including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and ternary operators. Understanding how they work together is key to writing efficient code. On to the next challenge!

Plenty of resources at - W3Schools.com, MDN Web Docs, and the JavaScript & jQuery book by Jon Duckett.
