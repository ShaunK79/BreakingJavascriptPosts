Documenting my learning by posting on LinkedIn

New Beginnings & Learning to Code üí°

After spending 14‚Äì15 years as an electrician, redundancy last year gave me the push to pursue something new‚Äîsoftware development. I‚Äôm currently studying and focusing on JavaScript, and I‚Äôve decided to document my journey here on LinkedIn.

Each week, I‚Äôll share what I‚Äôve learned, the challenges I‚Äôve faced, and my progress. My goal is not just to stay accountable but also to connect with others on a similar path, get advice, and hopefully inspire those thinking about making a career shift.

If you're also learning JavaScript (or already working in development), I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and any tips you have! Let‚Äôs grow together. üöÄ

My JavaScript Learning Journey üöÄ

This week, I started with the fundamentals: variables and data types in JavaScript. I learned how to declare variables using let, const, and var, and the importance of choosing the right one. I also explored different data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects‚Äîeach playing a key role in how JavaScript handles data.

One key takeaway: Understanding data types early makes debugging and writing clean code much easier!

Next week, I'll dive deeper into JavaScript fundamentals. If you have any tips or resources that helped you, I‚Äôd love to hear them!

Arrays and Operators.

This week, I completed arrays and operators. Fairly straightforward concepts, but there are many built-in methods and nuances to remember! I practiced different array operations like push, pop, toString, reverse and shift/unShift (many more). I also explored operators‚Äîincluding arithmetic, comparison, logical, and ternary operators. Understanding how they work together is key to writing efficient code. On to the next challenge!

Plenty of resources at - W3Schools.com, MDN Web Docs, and the JavaScript & jQuery book by Jon Duckett.

Functions

I dived into JavaScript functions: 
regular functions, anonymous functions, arrow functions, Immediately Invoked Function Expression(IIFEs), and callbacks. 
It was definitely a challenge at first trying to wrap my head around the different syntax and use cases which took some persistence. But eventually, after consistently practising and building small projects I could visually see how these functions work together and make the code more efficient was a real 'aha' moment, it all clicked!!!

Objects

I‚Äôve been diving deeper into JavaScript and strengthening my understanding of objects. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve covered:

 ‚úÖ Creating objects from scratch.
 ‚úÖ Accessing and updating object properties.
 ‚úÖ Adding new properties dynamically.
 ‚úÖ Adding functions.
 ‚úÖ Creating and using multi-word property names(keys) and accessing them correctly.

Objects are fundamental in JavaScript, and mastering them is a big step toward building more dynamic and functional web applications. 

Control Flow

hu! this was a challenge to dive into but something very important to learn and understand. 

Control Flow - how statements are to be read and executed in order, left-to-right, top-to-bottom

I had already touched up on operators - Logical and Logical assignment - previously but this was more in depth with added learning of - Conditional Statements ( if, if/else, nested if, switch ).

I think practice, practice, practice was key here for me to get to grips with it all and fully understand the concepts and how it works.
Onwards and upwards!!! üöÄ 

Events

This week we cover EVENTS!
Events are actions that happen in the browser, like when a user clicks a button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è , moves the mouse üñ±Ô∏è , presses a key *Ô∏è‚É£ or submits a form. JavaScript allows us to detect these actions and respond to them, creating more dynamic and engaging web pages .

I covered key event topics such as:

‚û°Ô∏è Adding event listeners ü¶ª 
‚û°Ô∏è Handling mouse and keyboard events ‚å®Ô∏è 
‚û°Ô∏è Using the event object 
‚û°Ô∏è Working with input and form submission 
‚û°Ô∏è Understanding event bubbling and event delegation
‚û°Ô∏è Reacting to window events like resizing

Even though events felt overwhelming at first. Practicing simple examples, building small challenges and visually breaking down when and where events happen made everything much easier and way more fun!

Asynchronous

Asynchronous JavaScript lets us do things without waiting.
Instead of freezing the whole webpage while something slow happens (like loading data or waiting for a user to click), JavaScript keeps working and listens for when the slow thing finishes.

It‚Äôs like cooking dinner while doing homework ‚Äî you don‚Äôt just stare at the oven, you do other things too!

The Challenges:
- Understanding timing: It's tricky to know when things actually happen.
- Callback Hell: When you have too many "do this, then that, then this..." it can get messy and confusing!
- Error handling: If something goes wrong, you need a smart way to catch and fix it without breaking everything else.

üåü The Success:
- Callbacks taught me the basics of "do this when ready."
- Promises made waiting easier and code cleaner.
- Async/Await made asynchronous code look just like normal step-by-step code ‚Äî super easy to read and manage!
- Error Handling with try/catch made it safer and stronger.

With Asynchronous JavaScript, our apps become faster, smarter and more fun to use!
