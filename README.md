Documenting my learning by posting on LinkedIn

New Beginnings & Learning to Code ðŸ’¡

After spending 14â€“15 years as an electrician, redundancy last year gave me the push to pursue something newâ€”software development. Iâ€™m currently studying and focusing on JavaScript, and Iâ€™ve decided to document my journey here on LinkedIn.

Each week, Iâ€™ll share what Iâ€™ve learned, the challenges Iâ€™ve faced, and my progress. My goal is not just to stay accountable but also to connect with others on a similar path, get advice, and hopefully inspire those thinking about making a career shift.

If you're also learning JavaScript (or already working in development), Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and any tips you have! Letâ€™s grow together. ðŸš€
