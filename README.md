Documenting my learning by posting on LinkedIn

New Beginnings & Learning to Code ðŸ’¡

After spending 14â€“15 years as an electrician, redundancy last year gave me the push to pursue something newâ€”software development. Iâ€™m currently studying and focusing on JavaScript, and Iâ€™ve decided to document my journey here on LinkedIn.

Each week, Iâ€™ll share what Iâ€™ve learned, the challenges Iâ€™ve faced, and my progress. My goal is not just to stay accountable but also to connect with others on a similar path, get advice, and hopefully inspire those thinking about making a career shift.

If you're also learning JavaScript (or already working in development), Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and any tips you have! Letâ€™s grow together. ðŸš€

Week 1: My JavaScript Learning Journey ðŸš€

This week, I started with the fundamentals: variables and data types in JavaScript. I learned how to declare variables using let, const, and var, and the importance of choosing the right one. I also explored different data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objectsâ€”each playing a key role in how JavaScript handles data.

One key takeaway: Understanding data types early makes debugging and writing clean code much easier!

Next week, I'll dive deeper into JavaScript fundamentals. If you have any tips or resources that helped you, Iâ€™d love to hear them!
